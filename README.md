## Overview of the Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis is to undertand the below metrics for future school budgets. 

- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school sizeÂ 
  - School performance based on the type of school

## Resources 

- Jupyter Notebook/Python
- schools_complete.csv
- students_complete.csv

## Summary

In this analysis, I needed to remove the ninth grade test scores from "Thomas High School". This included their Math and Reading scores. This did cause the averages for "Average Math Score", "Average Reading Score, "% Passing Math", "% Passing Reading", and "% Overall passing" to drop slightly. Overall, you can tell that small to medium size schools tend to get better test scores. There also does not seem to be an cooralation between spending more money per student and getting a higher test scores.
